# MVP Workshop - Day 4 - As Platform Engineer,

- Golden path PE-7: I want to assign a Developer to a Project
- Golden path PE-8: I want to allow a CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Workload

## Golden path PE-7: I want to assign a Developer to a Project

- Make sure that the Developer has access to your Humanitec Org as `Member`
- Onboard their Project (Humanitec App) if needed (see here)
- Assign this Developer to this Humanitec App as `Developer`.
- Assigne this Developer to the Environment Type `development` as `Deployer`

Opportunities:
- Once this training session passed, you will automate this.
- For later consideration, you may want to assign this Developer as `Viewer` and not `Developer`/`Deployer` (CI/CD will deploy).

## Golden path PE-8: I want to allow a CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Workload

- Create a Service User (in UI)
- Create a Token (in UI)
- Share it, to be used in the CI/CD pipeline

Opportunity: Once this training session passed, you will automate this.
